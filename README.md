This machine learning model aims to detect metastatic cancer in images of body tissue. This is an example of a beneficial use of deep learning, as it can make an immense difference in how quickly a patient can recieve a diagnosis, and potentially save their life. The dataset weâ€™re using is derived from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark. It consists of lots of small pathology image patches labeled to show if they contain cancerous tissue. Each image is 96x96 pixels, and we focus on the center 32x32 pixels to determine if there is cancer present. The training set has labeled images, while the test set is unlabeled. The model being used for image classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) The images are first preprocessed with normalization and augmentation, then the CNN is trained to minimize binary cross-entropyloss. The model is evaluated using the ROC AUC metric, which tells us how well it distinguishes between healthy and cancerous tissue. Overall, this project aims to create an effective cancer detection model, contributing toward making advanced diagnostic tools more accessible and efficient.
